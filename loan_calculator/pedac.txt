Objective: Build a loan calculator application using the same methods as for the dice-rolling application

Input: loan amount, loan duration
Output: 
  -loan amount, in dollars
  -loan duration, in years
  -the APR, as a percentage
  -the monthly payment, in dollars

Rules:
  -APR is set at 5%
  -Query string template: http://localhost:3000/?amount=5000&duration=10
  -Use this formula: let m = p * (j / (1 - Math.pow((1 + j), (-n))));
    -m = monthly payment
    -p = loan amount
    -j = monthly interest rate
    -n = loan duration in months
    -When you write your program, don't use the single-letter variables m, p, j, and n; use explicit names. 
      For instance, you may want to use loanAmount instead of p.
    -Try to print the payment amount as a dollar and cents amount, e.g., $123.45 or $371.00.
